# Welcome to the repository of *pythondojo*!

Dojo means practicing via smaller exercises. At *CodeCool* we often start the day with 1-2 hours of coding dojo. In such a case 2 people of the group sits in front of the projector and starts an exercise (often a [*Checkio*](www.checkio.org) task) in pair programming while the rest of us remains at their own notebook trying to solve the problem alone (or just simple copying all the lines from the projector).

This repository is a collection of our python dojo exercises at *CodeCool*. To avoid misunderstandings, not all the files are based on my own idea, as I am often tend to be in the copy-paste mode. But of course there are some files which represents my very-own idea.

At this point I have to mention Mentor Sody, who is one of the most active member on [*Checkio*](www.checkio.org) and for this reason he has a very huge source to pick up a dojo exercise from.

Please, have a look at some of these codes. Thank you!
